#DO NOT FORK YET!

COMP 124 HW 5:  Breakout!
==========================

For this homework assignment, you will write a program to play the classic arcade game of Breakout, which
was developed in 1976 by Steve Wozniak, who would later become one of the founders 
of Apple. In Breakout, your goal is to clear a collection of bricks by hitting each of them with 
a bouncing ball.

## The game 

The initial configuration of the Breakout game appears in the left image below. The colored 
rectangles in the top part of the screen are bricks in a wall, two rows each of red, orange, yellow, green, and cyan.
These colors are not required- you can choose to be creative about the colors and the size of the bricks
and the number of bricks in each row.

The slightly larger rectangle at the bottom is the paddle. The paddle is in a fixed position in the vertical 
dimension, but moves back and forth across the screen along with the mouse or keyboard until it 
reaches the edge of its space.

![Example of breakout game](./diagram.png)

A complete Breakout game consists of three turns, or lives. On each turn, a ball is launched from the center 
of the window towards the bottom of the screen at a random angle. That ball bounces off of the paddle and the walls 
of the world. Thus, after two bounces --- One off of the paddle and one off of the right wall --- the ball 
might have the trajectory shown in the second diagram. (*Note that the dotted line is illustrative to show the 
ball's path- it won't appear on the screen.*)

As you can see from the second diagram, the ball is about to collide with one of the bricks on the bottom row. 
When that happens, the ball 
bounces just as it does on any other collision, but the brick disappears. The third diagram shows what the game 
looks like after that collision and after you have moved the paddle to line it up with the 
oncoming ball. The play continues in this way until one of the following conditions occurs:

- The ball moves below the paddle, which means that the player must have missed it with the paddle. In this case, 
the turn ends and the next ball is served, assuming that you have not already exhausted your allotment of
three turns. If you have, the game ends in a loss.
- The last brick is eliminated. In this case, the game ends immediately, and you can retire in victory.

## Some implementation notes

You have license to vary the wall's size and placement and the spacing between it and the walls.
Your final product must have several rows of bricks in the wall.

To start the game, you can place the ball in the center and wait for 3 seconds, then begin the ball moving down 
towards one side or the other at an angle.

When a player loses a turn (or life), you can implement similar behavior: place the ball back in the center and wait 
for 3 seconds before starting the ball on its way downwards again.

After all the bricks in a particular column have been cleared, a path will open to the top wall. When this 
delightful situation occurs, the ball will often bounce back and forth several times between the top wall and the upper 
line of bricks without the user ever having to worry about hitting the ball with the paddle. This condition is the 
reward for "breaking out" and gives meaning to the name of the game.

It is important to note that, even though breaking out is a very exciting part of the player's experience,
you don't have to do anything special in your program to make it happen. The game is operated by the same rules as always:
bouncing off walls, clearing bricks from the wall by checking if the ball has hit them, and obeying the laws of physics.

One part of the implementation that does require some explanation is the problem of checking to see 
whether the ball has collided with a brick or the paddle. The easiest strategy to adopt 
is to call getElemntAt(x,y), which returns the object that covers the point (x,y) on the canvas. *Note that these checks
will occur in different methods in different classes if you use good decomposition.*

Given the ball is not a single point, it is not sufficient to check only the coordinates of the center. In this program, 
the simplest strategy is to check the four corner points on the square in which the ball is inscribed. The fact that an Ellipse
is defined in terms of its bounding rectangle means that if the upper left corner of the ball is at point (x,y), the other corners will be at the locations
shown in this diagram:

![Diagram of ball corner positions](./corners.png)

These points have the advantage of being outside the ball -- which means that getElementAt can't return the ball itself. Thus,
for each of the four corners, you need to call getElementAt on that location to see whether anything is there. If the value you get back 
is not null, you have a collision with either a brick or the paddle. 

## Program design

We expect you to decompose your program using at least three Graphics components in addition to the BreakoutProgram. 
Excellent designs will have four.
To accomplish this, you should read through the above problem description of the game and pull out all of the significant 
nouns that describe major objects that are part of the game. These will become your classes.

As you develop each class, you also need to practice good method decomposition to avoid code duplication and keep your 
methods short with a single clear purpose.

### Due Dates
This homework will have three milestones:

* **Part 1** : You will complete a class diagram with important instance variables and methods shown on the diagram.
This is so that we can discuss this together and compare designs either in a class or lab session.

* **Part 2** : For this milestone you only need to draw the graphical objects on the screen and have the ball animate. 
Your ball should be able to reflect off of walls, but does not need to test for intersections with bricks in the wall 
or the paddle. You will push this working code.

* **Part 3** : For this milestone you should commit and push the completed assignment. The ball should be able to bounce 
off of the paddle and intersect bricks. The paddle should be able to move with the mouse or keyboard. 
The game should end when all the bricks disappear or the player loses three lives. 

Please make sure to follow the guidelines for good Java style that we have shared with you in the past. 
Because this program is entirely graphical, you do not need to write JUnit tests; however, you should make 
sure you test thoroughly by playing the game.

To receive full credit, you must have:
* Good class decomposition
* Good method decomposition
* Correct Execution:
  * Ball/Brick Intersections
  * Win/Lose Logic
  * Ball/Wall Intersections
  * Ball/Paddle Intersections
* Correct Style
